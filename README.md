## Feature Engineering
We applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Normalized Gain for the best feature selections. The code can be found in pca.ipynb.

## Baseline Model
initial-ml.ipynb: This notebook reads in the data, resamples the categories and chooses the selected features from the feature engineering phase.
It also runs the 2 simple NN's and the other 7 ML models.
We also look at the performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, time taken. 

## Multi Task Model
